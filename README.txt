USB virus immunity script and hidden files revealer.
DOES NOT REMOVE VIRUSES. MUST BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM.

1. Download the script file (usb_vaccine.cmd)
2. Unplug all of your USB flash drives, so that if your USB flash drives are
   infected they won't interfere with your computer.
3. Run usb_vaccine.cmd the first time. It will disable the AutoRun and remove
   autorun.inf files from your hard drive.
4. If your Windows has other user accounts, log on to other users and run
   usb_vaccine.cmd FOR EVERY USER. This makes sure the MountPoints2 caches are
   all cleaned.
5. Plug in your USB flash drives again.
6. Run usb_vaccine.cmd again. This is the last time and will remove
   autorun.inf files from your flash drives. If some of the files have been
   hidden due to the infection, they will be all revealed, so your drives will
   be like normal.
