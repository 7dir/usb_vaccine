Compatibility with Windows NT 4.0

Windows NT 4 does support IniFileMapping registry key. So the AutoRun
IniFileMapping hack can work there. 

However, several limitations of batch scripting in Windows NT 4 Command
Processor makes it difficult to write scripts compatible with that platform
while making the script secure as well.

So, usb_vaccine.cmd is coded to only work with Windows 2000 or later.
(With Windows 2000 you need reg.exe from Support Tools. Unlike in XP it's not
available pre-installed.)

Here are limitations known in Windows NT 4 Command Processor environment:
- reg.exe v1.0 (in Win NT 4) has a different syntax than later version. It's
  "reg query KeyName\ValueName" rather than "reg query KeyName /v ValueName",
  the latter allowing a subkey and value to share the name name.

- "SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion" does not work, which is required for
  secure "SET /P" user input processing. %var% is vulnerable to command
  injection.

- "%~1" does not work.

- "EXIT /b" does not work, which is required for return codes in subroutines.

- 'FOR /F "usebackq"' does not work.
